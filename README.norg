* High Level Bindings for `tree-sitter`
  This repository hosts treesitter bindings for the Zig programming language.

  Although heavily work in progress, a lot of bindings are already functional - they are pretty low level
  bindings, but it's already a big step up over using the C APIs.

  A documentation set for how to link your own parser and for the APIs will be released after we're happy
  with the state of the project, so hang tight :)
